  <p>Small boats are typically found on inland waterways such as rivers and lakes, or in protected coastal areas.
    However, some boats,
    such as the whaleboat, were intended for use in an offshore environment. In modern naval terms, a boat is a vessel
    small enough to be
    carried aboard a ship.</p>
